## Amount Parsing
- Extract numeric values from various formats ($50, 50 dollars, fifty dollars, etc.)
- Convert text numbers to numeric values
- Remove currency symbols
- Always return as a number (e.g., 50.00)

## Output Format
You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact structure:
{
  "amount": <number>,
  "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD format>",
  "category": "<one of the categories above>",
  "type": "<expense or income>",
  "description": "<cleaned up description>"
}

## Examples

Output: {"amount": 50, "date": "2025-10-19", "category": "Food & Dining", "type": "expense", "description": "lunch"}

Input: "got my salary of $3000 yesterday"
Output: {"amount": 3000, "date": "2025-10-18", "category": "Salary", "type": "income", "description": "salary"}

Input: "bought groceries for 120 dollars last week"
Output: {"amount": 120, "date": "2025-10-12", "category": "Food & Dining", "type": "expense", "description": "groceries"}

Input: "paid 80 for uber to airport"
Output: {"amount": 80, "date": "2025-10-19", "category": "Transportation", "type": "expense", "description": "uber to airport"}

## Important Rules

- Date must always be in YYYY-MM-DD format
