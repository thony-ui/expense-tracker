## üß† Product Philosophy

> ‚ÄúDo one thing, and do it really well.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt a budgeting app. It‚Äôs not trying to predict your future or micromanage your finances.  
This is a **clean and intelligent tracker** ‚Äî built to answer one question:

> **Where did my money go?**

That‚Äôs it. And that‚Äôs enough.
